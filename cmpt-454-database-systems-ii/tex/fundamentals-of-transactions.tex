\section{Fundamentals of Transactions}
	\label{sec:fundamentals-of-transactions}
\begin{easylist}

& Operations:
	&& \textbf{Commit operation:} Database transaction operation which declares the transaction to be applied, even upon system crash
	&& \textbf{End operation:} Database transaction operation which declares the transaction to be complete

& Notation; given transaction $1$, page $A$, and LSN $X$:
	&& Read operation: $R1(A)$
	&& Write operation: $W1(A)$ or $T1 UPDATE A$
		&&& Modifies RAM; writing to disk is determined separately by replacement policy
	&& Abort operation: $T1 ABORT$
	&& Undo operation: $T1 CLR LSN X, undonextLSN = X$
	&& Commit operation: $C1$ or $T1 COMMIT$
	&& End operation: $T1 END$
	&& Begin/end checkpoints: $Begin_checkpoint$ and $End_checkpoint$

& \textbf{Transaction (Xact):} Single data access footprint of an SQL statement
	&& Consists of a sequence of read, write, commit, and abort actions
	&& Notation: $Tx$ where $x$ is a number signifying a specific transcation
		&&& Sequence of concurrent transactions: $T1T2\ldots$
	&& \textbf{Transaction ID (XID):} Unique identifier for a transaction
	&& \textbf{Atomic:} Transaction where either all read/write actions are executed or none are

& \textbf{Schedule:} Execution of multiple transactions where the order of reads/writes in each individual transaction are preserved
	&& \textbf{Complete schedule:} Schedule where every transaction ends with either a commit or abort action
	&& ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties of schedules:
		&&& \textbf{Atomic schedule:} Schedule where all transactions are atomic
		&&& \textbf{Consistent schedule:} Schedule where, if the initial DB is in a consistent state, the resulting DB must also be in a consistent state
		&&& \textbf{Isolated schedule:} Schedule where an aborted transaction does not cause other transactions to be inconsistent
		&&& \textbf{Durable schedule:} Schedule where committed transactions must persist their write operations, regardless of system crash

& \textbf{Blind write:} Write operation on a given data item, which has no previous read operation on the data item in the transaction
