\section{Logging and Recovery}
	\label{sec:logging-and-recovery}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Logging and recovery:} Strategy to ensure database atomicity and durability
	&& If consistency and isolation are maintained (e.g. through strict 2PL), then logging and recovery guarantees Atomicity and Durability
	&& \textbf{Recovery manager:} Component which manages logging and recovery

	&& Example logs:
	\begin{lstlisting}
	10 T1 UPDATE P1
	20 T2 UPDATE P2
	30 T1 UPDATE P3 (STEAL)
	40 T1 COMMIT
	50 T2 UPDATE P3
	60 T1 END
	70 T2 COMMIT
	80 T2 END
	\end{lstlisting}

& Atomicity:
	&& Aborted transactions should have their effects nullified, and should not affect other transactions

& Durability:
	&& Committed transactions (whether written to disk or not) should persist
	&& Uncommitted transactions should be rolled back
	&& Assumes that the buffer-pool is updated on writes, and write to disk only occurs occasionally
		&&& \textbf{Buffer-pool:} Main memory holding the frames of data currently used by the database

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Solutions for Atomicity and Durability}
	\label{subsec:solutions-for-atomicity-and-durability}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Force:} Solution for durability where every write operation is immediately written to disk
	&& Response time is slow
	
& \textbf{Steal:} Solution for atomicity where dirty buffer frames in use by in-progress, uncommitted transactions are written to disk to free up the frame
	&& Example logs of a steal:
	\begin{lstlisting}
	10 T1 UPDATE P1 (STEAL)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	&& Before writing a stolen page to disk, the old disk page is logged
	&& If the transaction which was stolen from is aborted, then the disk write must be rolled back to the saved logged value
	&& Increases throughput
	&& Flushes the log tail (see subsection~\ref{subsec:transaction-log-information})

& Optimal solution: \textbf{Steal/No Force policy}

	&& Before writing a stolen page to disk, the old disk page is logged

	&& Before committing a transaction, the value of the dirty page is logged

	&& Upon a system crash and restart:
		&&& Crashed transactions must UNDO all changes by restoring from the saved logged pages (Steal strategy)
		&&& Committed transactions which had dirty pages must REDO all dirty pages and the commit by restoring from the saved logged pages (No Force strategy)

	& \textbf{Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):} Logging strategy for recovery where all changes are logged, and the log buffer is flushed to the log just before stealing a dirty page or committing a page

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Transaction Log Information}
	\label{subsec:transaction-log-information}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Logging:} Strategy where each write operation also creates REDO and UNDO information in a log file
	&& Must use diff information
	&& Must be safe from crashes

& \textbf{Log tail:} Memory buffer used to hold data before writing to a log
	&& Flushed upon:
		&&& A steal
		&&& A commit action
		&&& $\textrm{end\_checkpoint}$ (see below)

& \textbf{Log record:} Line of data in a log representing a single change
	&& Format: $\langle \textrm{XID,\ pageID,\ offset,\ length,\ old\ data,\ new\ data} \rangle$
	&& Significantly smaller than entire pages; represents a change made to a page
	&& \textbf{Log Sequence Number (LSN):} Value which uniquely identifies a log record
		&&& \textbf{flushedLSN:} Value identifying the last-flushed log record from the log tail
		&&& \textbf{pageLSN:} LSN value on a disk page representing the most recent update



& \textbf{Transaction Table (TT):} Table containing a record for each active transaction
	&& Records are:
		&&& Added upon first execution of a transaction's operation
		&&& Updated upon a transaction's subsequent operations (including commits)
		&&& Removed upon execution of the $\textrm{END}$ operation
	&& Format: $\langle \textrm{XID,\ status,\ lastLSN} \rangle$
		&&& Status: Transaction status (uncommitted/committed/aborted)
		&&& \textbf{lastLSN:} LSN value representing the most recent log record when the transaction executed a write action
	&& Example of a TT: See figure~\ref{tab:transaction-table}
	\end{easylist}
	\begin{figure}[!htb]
		\caption{Example of a Transaction Table}
		\label{tab:transaction-table}
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ c | c r }
			XID & Status & lastLSN \\
			\hline
			T1 & U & 100 \\
			T2 & C & 80
		\end{tabular}
	\end{figure}
	\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Dirty Page Table (DPT):} Table containing a record for each dirty page
	&& Records are:
		&&& Added upon the modification of a non-dirty page
		&&& Removed upon $\textrm{STEAL}$ing the page or upon writing the page to disk
	&& Format: $\langle \textrm{pageID,\ recLSN} \rangle$
		&&& \textbf{recLSN:} LSN value representing the first log record which caused the page to become dirty
	&& Example of a DPT: See figure~\ref{tab:dirty-page-table}
	\end{easylist}
	\begin{figure}[!htb]
		\caption{Example of a Dirty Page Table}
		\label{tab:dirty-page-table}
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ l | r }
			Page & recLSN \\
			\hline
			P1 & 50 \\
			P3 & 70
		\end{tabular}
	\end{figure}
	\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Checkpoint (chkpt):}  Regular interval at which the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table are written to disk for crash prevention
	&& Limits the amount of log required to analyze upon recovery
	&& \textbf{begin\_checkpoint:} Log record signifying the time at which the TT and DPT were saved
	&& \textbf{end\_checkpoint:} Log record signifying at which time the checkpoint was finished being written to disk
		&&& Flushes the log tail
	&& Checkpoint LSNs are logged - for example:
	\begin{lstlisting}
	10 T1 UPDATE P1
	20 begin_checkpoint
	30 T1 UPDATE P2
	40 end_checkpoint
	\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Aborting}
	\label{subsec:aborting}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Abort:} Action where an in-progress, uncommitted transaction is reverted

& Procedure to abort a single transaction $T$:
	&& Write a $\textrm{T ABORT}$ record to log
	&& From the TT, retrieve $T$'s $\textrm{lastLSN}$
	&& For each update starting at $\textrm{lastLSN}$:
		&&& Undo the update to disk
		&&& Log the UNDO action as $T\_ CLR LSN\_ undonextLSN=\_$
			&&&& \textbf{CLR:} Log record value in an ABORT/UNDO action which states that a specified LSN has been undone
		&&& Take the $\textrm{prevLSN}$ from the undone action to set the $\textrm{undonextLSN}$ value
			&&&& \textbf{undonextLSN:} Log record value which indicates the next LSN to be undone
		&&& Update the $\textrm{pageLSN}$ in the Transaction Table
		&&& Queue another action to undo $\textrm{undonextLSN}$
	&& If there are no more actions to undo:
		&&& Release all locks held
		&&& Write a $\textrm{T END}$ record to log

& Example logs from an abort:
\begin{lstlisting}
10 T1 UPDATE P1
20 T1 UPDATE P2
30 T1 ABORT
40 T1 CLR LSN 20, undonextLSN=10
50 T1 CLR LSN 10, undonextLSN=nil
60 T1 END
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Recovering from Crashes}
	\label{subsec:recovering-from-crashes}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Crash:} Loss of power which causes everything in memory (log tail, TT, DPT, and dirty pages) to be lost
	&& Flushed log, master record, and written data pages survive a crash
	&& \textbf{Repeated crash:} Subsequent crash which occurs during recovery of an initial crash
	
& \textbf{Recovery:} Crash restart process where the TT and DPT are restored, all active transactions are redone, and all uncommitted transactions are undone

& Procedures in order: ANALYZE, REDO, UNDO
	&& Only UNDO will add new log records



& \textbf{ANALYZE:} Recovery procedure which restores the TT and DPT from the most recent \\ $\textrm{begin\_checkpoint}$ (logged on the master record) and reconstructs the remaining unsaved changes using the logged actions
	&& Difference from the TT and DPT lost at crash: Steals are not reflected in the reconstructed DPT



& \textbf{REDO:} Recovery procedure which begins from the smallest recLSN in the DPT and re-dos all logged actions
	&& Applies actions to disk
	&& Applies to all actions, even for aborted transactions
	&& No logs are added/modified, only data actions are executed
	&& No redo is executed (i.e. an update has already been written to disk) if any of the following are true:
		&&& The page is not in the DPT
		&&& The $\textrm{recLSN}$ in the DPT is greater than the current LSN
		&&& The $\textrm{pageLSN}$ of the page is greater or equal to the current LSN
	&& When redoing a $\textrm{CLR}$ record:
		&&& Reapply the $\textrm{UNDO}$ from the record to the data
		&&& Update $\textrm{pageLSN}$ to the $\textrm{CLR}$ record to avoid repeated redos

\clearpage
	
& \textbf{UNDO:} Recovery procedure for a single uncommitted transaction which begins from the $\textrm{lastLSN}$ in the TT, and un-dos all actions in the transaction
	&& \textbf{Loser:} Transaction which was not yet committed when a crash happened, and requires rolling back
	&& Transactions are undone starting from the greatest $\textrm{lastLSN}$
	&& Procedure to UNDO transactions:
		&&& Create a list of LSNs $\textrm{ToUndo}$
		&&& For each transaction which was uncommitted when the crash happened, add its $\textrm{lastLSN}$ to $\textrm{ToUndo}$
		
		&&& Until $\textrm{ToUndo}$ is empty, take the largest LSN:
			&&&& If the action is an $\textrm{Abort}$, add its $\textrm{prevLSN}$ to $\textrm{ToUndo}$
			&&&& If the action is an $\textrm{Update}$:
				&&&&& Undo the update on disk
				&&&&& Write $CLR$ as the new log record
				&&&&& If the undone record's $\textrm{prevLSN}$ is not null, add it to $\textrm{ToUndo}$
			&&&& If the action is a $CLR$ record:
				&&&&& If $\textrm{undoNextLSN}$ is null, then write the $\textrm{END}$ record for this transaction
				&&&&& If $\textrm{undoNextLSN}$ is not null, then add the $\textrm{undoNextLSN}$ record to $\textrm{ToUndo}$
	&& Example logs from UNDO:
		\begin{lstlisting}
		110 CLR T1 UNDO LSN = 100, undoNextLSN =10 
		120 CLR T2 UNDO LSN = 90, undoNextLSN = 50
		130 CLR T2 UNDO LSN = 50, undoNestLSN = 20
		\end{lstlisting}



& Optimization:
	&& To reduce work required by the ANALYSIS phase, save DPT and TT checkpoints more frequently
	&& To reduce work required by the REDO phase, flush pages to disk often and asynchronously
	&& To reduce work required by the UNDO phase, avoid long-running transactions (e.g. break up into shorter transactions)
	
& \textbf{Media recovery:} Recovery of data from a corrupted database object
	&& Process:
		&&& Occasionally copy a data item
		&&& Upon corruption, restore the copy and use checkpoints and logs to update
			&&&& Redo actions of committed transactions
			&&&& Undo actions of uncommitted transactions
	&& Regularly copying a data item is expensive
